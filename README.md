Replaced by https://github.com/caltechlibrary/CMTools

Metagenesys ("_**Meta**data **gene**rator u**s**ing P**y**thon **s**etup.cfg_") takes the information from a Python `setup.cfg` file and generates a `codemeta.json` file.

Introduction
------------

The goal of [CodeMeta](https://codemeta.github.io) is to create a concept vocabulary to standardize the exchange of software metadata across repositories and organizations.  A _CodeMeta instance file_ (named [`codemeta.json`](https://codemeta.github.io/user-guide/) by convention) describes the metadata associated with a software object using JSON's linked data ([JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org)) notation, with a [standardized set of terms](https://codemeta.github.io/terms/).

Currently, software authors have to write `codemeta.json` files by hand or use tools such as the [CodeMeta generator](https://codemeta.github.io/codemeta-generator/).  Python developers also frequently use [setuptools](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/) to configure their software in a reproducible manner, and in 2016, [setuptools version 30.3.0](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/history.html#v30-3-0) introduced a declarative file format, [`setup.cfg`](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#configuring-setup-using-setup-cfg-files), where authors can put configuration information that previously went into `setup.py` files.  A glance at `setup.cfg` files shows that the information contained in them includes some of the same information that is needed by `codemeta.json` files.  This presents an opportunity to automate the creation of a project `codemeta.json` file from something that Python developers already create for other purposes.
 
Metagenesys is a program to create and keep in sync a `codemeta.json` file from a Python package's `setup.cfg` file.
